## This is my first blog post, the heading is H2

Here's a little bit of flavor text

A code block
 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
 
Testing markup:

**this is bold text**

1. The first item in an ordered list
2. The second item in an ordered list
6. The (sixth?) item

{% include plotly.html %}

<script>
var theCanvas = document.getElementBy
